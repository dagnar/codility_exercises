# Ruby Codility Exercise Solutions

Ruby solutions to the Codility exercises at https://codility.com/programmers/lessons/

All solutions are optimized for speed. Unfortunately, that kinda kills being idiomatic sometimes.

These solutions were curated with lots of help from [jsuchal](https://github.com/jsuchal/codility).

Run all the tests: `$ rspec`
